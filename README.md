## Computational Simulations for DFT Calculations

This repository documents my work on performing and managing large-scale computational simulations using Density Functional Theory (DFT). The project focuses on automating quantum mechanical simulations, organizing computational workflows, and systematically extracting meaningful physical insights from first-principles calculations.

Density Functional Theory is a powerful quantum mechanical framework used to study the electronic structure of atoms, molecules, and solid-state materials. Through this work, I have applied DFT methodologies to investigate structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of materials at the atomic scale. The simulations were designed to ensure reproducibility, efficiency, and consistency across multiple computational experiments.

The primary objective of this project was to build an organized and automated simulation pipeline capable of handling numerous DFT calculations. Instead of running isolated simulations manually, I developed structured workflows that allow systematic variation of parameters such as lattice configurations, atomic substitutions, spin states, and convergence thresholds. This enabled high-throughput computational studies and comparative material analysis.

A significant part of the work involved preprocessing input configurations, ensuring structural optimization, and verifying convergence criteria such as total energy stability, force minimization, and k-point mesh accuracy. Careful validation was carried out to ensure that each simulation reached physically meaningful and numerically stable results.

Beyond running calculations, I focused heavily on post-processing and data interpretation. The raw outputs generated from DFT simulations were analyzed to extract quantities such as total energies, band structures, density of states, magnetic moments, and electronic distributions. These extracted results were then organized and compared across different configurations to identify trends and underlying physical mechanisms.

The computational studies performed in this repository contribute to understanding material behavior at the quantum level. By analyzing how electronic structure changes with structural modifications or compositional adjustments, the simulations help predict stability, conductivity, magnetism, and other fundamental properties.

Another key contribution of this work is workflow automation. Running DFT calculations for multiple systems can be computationally demanding and time-intensive. To address this, I implemented batch-processing strategies and systematic data management approaches. This ensured that large numbers of simulations could be executed efficiently while maintaining clarity and traceability of results.

Accuracy and reproducibility were central to the project. Each simulation setup was carefully documented with defined parameters, exchange-correlation functionals, and convergence settings. This allows the computational experiments to be replicated and verified by other researchers.

Overall, this repository reflects a comprehensive computational study involving:

• Design and execution of density functional theory simulations

• Structural optimization and convergence analysis

• Systematic parameter exploration

• Extraction and interpretation of electronic and magnetic properties

• Automation of simulation workflows

• Organization and comparative analysis of computational results

This work demonstrates practical application of quantum mechanical modeling tools to solve real-world materials science and condensed matter physics problems. It highlights both theoretical understanding and hands-on computational implementation in the field of first-principles simulations.
